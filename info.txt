Tried to follow this Vagrant tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBreXjkizgo&t=1857s

I faced issues running the "bootstrap.sh" example. It seems that the PHP 7 packages are no longer available for Ubuntu Server 14.04LTS.

So I figured out to make the same working with PHP 7.3 using Vagrant box: https://app.vagrantup.com/sub0/boxes/ubuntu1804
